Mayak Rails Website Template
============================

Mayak - is simple Rails application made for fast start of a common web-project.
I called it 'site template' because rails 'application templates'
[already exist](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/rails_application_templates.html).
Website template gives you major components of (almost) any website:

* admin panel
* settings
* arbitrary files upload
* pages managment
* seo parameters system
* navigation items
* news
* feedback form

[Mayak.io](http://mayak.io/) â€” project's website.


Software and coventions
-----------------------

Template based on Ruby 2.2.3 and use many brilliant ruby gems (check full list
and versions in Gemfile):

* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* [ActiveAdmin](http://activeadmin.info/) for admin panel
* [CarrierWave](https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave) for uploads
* [Kaminari](https://github.com/amatsuda/kaminari) for pagination
* [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for easy css
* [Mina](http://nadarei.co/mina/) for deploy

Also we use:

* [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
* [Dymio's HTML CSS template](https://github.com/dymio/html-css-template)
* [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/)

And we respect [humans.txt](http://humanstxt.org/) convention.
