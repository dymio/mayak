# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# def time_point_string
#   Time.now.strftime("%H:%M:%S:%L")
# end

# def seedfile(fname)
#   File.open File.join(Rails.root, "public/content/seeds/", fname)
# end

# puts "#{time_point_string}: Start seeding"

# # Use code of file 'db/seeds_more.rb'. This is way to split big seeds.rb file.
# # You can use instance variables (@something) declared in that file.
# require_relative 'seeds_more'

# puts "#{time_point_string}: seed Static Files"
# = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = - = --

# sig = StaticFile.new
# sig.file = seedfile "example_pic.jpg"
